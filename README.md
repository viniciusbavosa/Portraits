This is the Frontend of a FullStack application that communicates with its own [API](https://github.com/viniciusbavosa/portraits-api). Developed with **[React](https://react.dev/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).**

This website was developed to serve as a personal gallery. It features a authentication-protected route that allows uploading new photos from a local machine directly to the website through its [API](https://github.com/viniciusbavosa/portraits-api) and an [Nodejs automation script](https://github.com/viniciusbavosa/portraits-node-script).
